## 🧠 Sliding Window Problems Solved
1. [Maximum Sum Subarray of Size K](https://leetcode.com/problems/max-consecutive-ones-iii/)  
   → Fixed window technique  
2. [Longest Substring with At Most K Distinct Characters](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-substring-with-at-most-k-distinct-characters/)  
   → Variable window, HashMap-based  
3. [Number of Subarrays with Sum Equals K](https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-subarrays-with-sum/)  
   → Sliding window
4. [Number of Substrings Containing All Three Characters](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-substrings-containing-all-three-characters/)  
   → Sliding window + hashmap/array
